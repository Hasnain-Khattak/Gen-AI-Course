      "1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a set of data, without making inferences or predictions about the population. Examples of descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and data visualization techniques (histograms, box plots).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inferential Statistics**: Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory to estimate population parameters and make conclusions about the population. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
