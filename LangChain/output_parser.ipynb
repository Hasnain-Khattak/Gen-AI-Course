    "**In LangChain, an Output Parser is a utility that helps process and structure the raw output generated by a language model into a more usable or structured format. It is especially useful when working with tasks that require the model's response to adhere to a specific structure, such as JSON, key-value pairs, or well-defined formats.**\n",
